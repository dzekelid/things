    # Introduction
    What does your API do?

    Abusive content specifier specifies whether the content is abusive or not.

    # Overview
    Things that the developers should know about

    The API accepts the input parameters as form-data.

    Response will be in JSON as shown below:

    ```
    {
      "usage": "By accessing ParallelDots API or using information generated by ParallelDots API, you are agreeing to be bound by the ParallelDots API Terms of Use: http://www.paralleldots.com/terms-and-conditions",
      "sentence_type": "Abusive",
      "confidence_score": 0.953125
    }

    ```

    # Authentication
    What is the preferred way of using the API?

    An API key is required to be sent as a parameter to authenticate your requests.


    # Rate limit
    Is there a limit to the number of requests an user can send?

    There is no rate limit as such but too many concurrent requests will throw 504 time-out error from nginx.
